# Async php

Compared with other async programming frameworks or software such as Nginx, Tornado, Node.js, Open Swoole is a complete async solution that has built-in support for async programming via fibers/coroutines, a range of multi-threaded I/O modules (HTTP Server, WebSockets, TaskWorkers, Process Pools) and support for popular PHP clients like PDO for MySQL, Redis and CURL.

You can use sync or async, coroutine, fiber API to write the applications or create thousands of light weight fibers within one Linux process.

Swoole enhances the efficiency of your PHP applications and brings you out of the traditional stateless model, enabling you to focus on the development of innovative products at high scale, brining event loops and asynchronous programming to the PHP language.

- Event-driven, PHP Coroutine, PHP Fiber, Asynchronous API

- Async TCP / UDP / HTTP / Websocket / HTTP2 Client / Server Side API

- IPv4 / IPv6 / UnixSocket / TCP / UDP and SSL / TLS / DTLS

- Native PHP Coroutine and PHP Fiber Support

- High performance, scalable, support C1000K

- Milliseconds task scheduler

- Free and Open Source (Apache 2 License)

- Multiprocessing and Daemonize

## Start

To start this project you need to first install swoole using docker or via terminal and after you already can start the project.
Bellow I added the link of documentation to install swoole in your machine.

In this example, I installed via terminal, but you can use the dock, the project will run the same way.
